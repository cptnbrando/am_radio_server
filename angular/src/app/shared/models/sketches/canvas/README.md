Oy, so you wanna add a sketch and make ya own magic
Be a picasso ay?

Well, first copy another file and rename it to something fun. Change the class name and any references to your new name.
Then, go to am_radio\angular\src\app\components\radio-page\visualizer\visualizer.component.ts
Update the function sketches there, add your newly exported class to the list.

Oh, you don't like this process? Me neither. There should be an array or something, maybe a custom type, somewhere, and we just add to that and be done with it.
Maybe you, fellow traveler, you can add this functionality? As I've detailed it above, it is quite simple.
No? You don't want to? Me neither!

Add a new .png file for the thumbnail into the am_radio\angular\src\assets\img\viz\ folder.
This needs to be 500x500 to play nice with the other thumbnails
Then, go to am_radio\angular\src\app\components\radio-page\radio-page.component.ts and add a name and the png name to the presets array there.

Aight, do your thing cowboy ðŸ¤
